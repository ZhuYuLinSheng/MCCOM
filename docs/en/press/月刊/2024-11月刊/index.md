# MCJPG Organization November 2024 Edition

## Foreword

As of the publication date, the **MCJPG Organization** has been established for three months. As time passes, more and more players and servers have joined this new organization.  
Many have made contributions to it, and we would like to express our gratitude here.

## Projects

During this time, the **MCJPG Organization** has focused on development work, ~~thus the promotional efforts were delayed~~  
Here are the projects we have developed during this period:

### Status Monitoring

We have launched a more intuitive status monitoring system that records detailed logs, which can be found at the [status monitoring system](https://bstatus.mcjpg.org/).  
However, the original [status monitoring](https://status.mcjpg.org/) will not cease operations, and monitoring for various servers will continue to be updated there.  
The new status monitoring will only be used for monitoring **MCJPG** official services.

### Markdown Editor

The **MCJPG Organization** has deployed the open-source online Markdown editor [Arya](https://github.com/nicejade/markdown-online-editor),  
which helps players and server owners quickly and conveniently edit Markdown text.

### AI Chat

Based on the open-source project [LobeChat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat), the **MCJPG Organization** has set up a [visual AI chat webpage](https://chat.mcjpg.org/).  
However, users still need to provide their own API.  
In the near future, **MCJPG** will offer **free** AI services for server owners in need, so stay tuned.

### Server List Sync Mod

In the past month, **MCJPG** has improved the **ServerListSync** mod developed by its development department.  
This mod provides cloud synchronization features for multiplayer game server lists in the game.  
The mod is available in the **MCJPG** custom modpack.  
Release address: [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/serverlistsync).  
For more details, please see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MineJPGcraft/ServerListSync).

### MCJPG Custom Modpack

After more than a month of improvements, the modpack has finally been officially released. It is currently available only in the [Community group](https://qm.qq.com/q/bAZle5ABzy) and will be released on Modrinth soon.  
This modpack includes numerous utility, optimization, and assistive mods, making it ready to use right out of the box. It also contains the aforementioned **ServerListSync** mod.  
The modpack is suitable for all players on high versions, and we welcome you to try it out.

## Collaboration

After discussions, **MCJPG Organization** has officially established a partnership with the [Peach Blossom Source Association](http://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?_wv=1027&k=_f6OAfAbCuyIbiny20DsPSd33-Zx-hRU&authKey=6kJlwUInU9ZPwU2SureaIgMLq%2FMMHWB0FsBbai5qdoch8uk%2BxPBp4cMOg2evXWXy&noverify=0&group_code=415027991).  
In the days to come, we will work together to contribute to the development of the domestic **Minecrafrt** community.

## Conclusion

Thank you to all players for your support and trust in **MCJPG**. We will continue to provide better services for everyone in the future.  
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
