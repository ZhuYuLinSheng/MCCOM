# Server Publicity Guidelines
Hello, server administrators!

We are pleased to announce that the **MCJPG** community has partnered with **HiMCBBS** and **ZITBBS** to provide a broader publicity platform for eligible server administrators. We will offer publicity opportunities for your server in the respective forum sections, hoping to help you attract more players and expand your server's influence.
Before submitting your server, please carefully read the server publicity requirements on [HiMCBBS Forum](https://www.himcbbs.com/threads/94), [ZITBBS](https:///www.zitbbs.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=1454&extra=page%3D1), and this [guidance document](https://www.minebbs.com/threads/minebbs.4448/).

Below is a simple summary of these requirements, specifically what needs to be met for promotion through **MCJPG**.
For content that does not meet the requirements, **MCJPG** may **modify or return it**.

## **I. Publicity Material Submission Checklist**

To help you prepare, please ensure your materials include at least all of the following.

### **1. Post Title**

The title will strictly adhere to the format: **`[Game Version] Server Name - One-sentence Feature Description/Keyword Combination`**.

*   **Game Version**: Must be enclosed in **English** square brackets `[ ]`. If multiple versions, please use the `[Min-Max]` format.
*   **Server Name**: Your server must have a unique, non-generic name.
*   **One-sentence Description**: Should highly summarize the server's core gameplay or features, for example: "Vanilla Survival | Slimefun | Harmonious Chill-out | RPG".

> **Title Example:**
>
> *   `[1.20.1] ZITBBS World - Slimefun | Skyblock | Chill-out | RPG`
> *   `[1.12.2-1.19.4] Hi World - A Multi-Gameplay Slimefun Server~`

### **2. Server Core Information**

Please provide the following information, which we will fill in the standard information bar at the top of the post:

*   **Server Type**: Java Edition / Bedrock Edition / Cross-platform
*   **Main Gameplay**: Survival / Creative / Modded / RPG / Minigames, etc. **(Select only one)**
*   **Supported Versions**: (Required) Detailed version numbers supported by the server.
*   **Server IP/Address + Port**: (Required)
    *If you have multiple domains, please choose the most stable and user-friendly one. Only one can be provided in this field.
    For example: v4 NAT traversal and IPv6 DDNS, prioritize IPv6 DDNS (unless NAT traversal can achieve bandwidth and latency similar to IPv6).*
*   **Official QQ Group**: (Must be provided)
*   **Official Website Address**: (Optional)
*   **Client Required?**: (Required)

### **3. Post Body Content**

This is the main focus of your publicity; please ensure a detailed and vivid introduction.

*   **Text Content**: The total word count of the body text (including descriptive text within images) **must not be less than 300 words**. Please introduce the server's background, gameplay, featured systems, management team, and future plans in detail.
*   **Promotional Images**: **Provide at least 4 high-quality in-game screenshots of the server**.
    *   This must include at least one screenshot showing actual **gameplay**, not just aesthetic scenic shots or architectural renders with shaders.
    *   If you provide a single long promotional image, please be sure to include a complete text version of the description below it. This facilitates search engine indexing and AI summarization.
*   **Whitelist Explanation**: If the server is whitelist-based, please clearly and thoroughly explain the review channels and application methods in the body text.
*   **Promotional Video**: (Optional) If you have a Bilibili promotional video, you can provide the link, and we will embed it in the post.

### **4. Core Rules and Considerations**

To avoid your promotional post being deleted or modified, please adhere to the following core rules:

*   **One Server, One Post Principle**: A server is only allowed one promotional post at a time across all partner forums. If the server closes or changes its cycle, please contact us promptly for handling.
*   **Prohibition of Copyright-disputed Content**: Strictly forbidden to publish servers involving content with clear copyright disputes, such as "Pok√©mon/Pocket Monsters" or "Douluo Dalu (Soul Land)".
*   **Definition of Non-profit Server**: If your server is defined as non-profit, please ensure that there are "no forms of projects that can disrupt game fairness or gain in-game advantages through payment" within the server. Commercial servers posing as non-profit servers are strictly prohibited.

## **II. Content to Submit**

To ensure your promotional materials are published in the format you expect, please provide clear formatting guidance. **MCJPG** suggests you prepare your promotional content as **a single long image** and attach the promotional content (or its keywords) after it.
You can also provide the content in **Rich Text** format or **Markdown** format, or edit the materials according to your wishes and send us a **PDF**. If provided in Rich Text format, please attach all unformatted text after the Rich Text content. This will reduce our burden when posting on **HiMCBBS**.

***The content of Section I-2 above must be provided in text format!***

## III. Submission Method

Please send the content to be submitted to [yubaozhi@mcjpg.org](mailto:yubaozhi@mcjpg.org), and initiate a temporary conversation with **[Publicity Department] Yubaozhi (QQ:3573281934)** via the group [MCJPG Server Administration Exchange Group](https://qm.qq.com/q/UGErfSeiYy), stating your email's sender address and subject.
Sending your content via email helps us archive your content more easily.

Server administrators, please read the above requirements carefully and prepare your promotional materials. A high-quality, detailed promotional post is the first step to attracting players. We look forward to collaborating with you to bring more exciting worlds to players!
