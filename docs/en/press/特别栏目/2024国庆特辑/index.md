# 2024 National Day Special Edition

## Overview
As of the 2024 National Day, the **MCJPG** organization has been established for the second month.  
During these two months of the organization’s existence, many people have contributed, and the organization has grown stronger.  
At the time of writing, **40** servers have joined the **MCJPG** organization, and the [community group](https://go.flweb.cn/qunmcwp "Community Group") has reached **120** members.  
The number of leaders has increased from the initial 5 founding server owners including 随风潜入夜, to currently comprising 4 members in the technical department, 3 in the publicity department, and 4 in the community department.  

## Our Actions
While opening up to the public, we are also committed to providing better services to players and server owners. We have established the [Community Exchange Center](https://com.mcjpg.org/ "Community Exchange Center"), the [Community Image Hosting](https://image.mcjpg.org/ "Community Image Hosting"), and the [Server Status Monitoring](https://status.mcjpg.org/ "Server Status Monitoring").  
These platforms help everyone to engage more conveniently in developing and playing Minecraft.  

### For Players
We have built an easy-to-navigate [official website](/ "Official Website") to help players find their preferred servers.  
Additionally, we have launched [MC Navigation](/nav/ "MC Navigation") on the website to facilitate use by players and server owners. This page ranks as high as third on Bing and is also well-ranked on Google.  

### For Server Owners
We offer fully customizable xxx@mcjpg.org emails for communication.  
We also provide each server owner in need with a xxx.mcjpg.org domain to connect to their servers and establish their websites.  
Furthermore, our bots in the community and server owner groups are integrated with [status monitoring](https://status.mcjpg.org "Status Monitoring"), allowing real-time server status checks through bot notifications (though sometimes it can be quite noisy).

### Promotional Activities
As of writing, we have published two promotional videos on Bilibili, namely the [Community Promotional Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pH4GehErc/ "Community Promotional Video") and the [Organization Promotional Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11geceREMb/ "Organization Promotional Video"). Both have achieved good viewership.

## But That’s Not All...
As you can see, **MCJPG** is still an organization in need of improvement. We welcome valuable suggestions from all players and server owners.  
For friends with capabilities, you can come and [join us](https://docs.qq.com/form/page/DZWhlcXZnZWZVUmhR#/result "Join Us"). Even if you are a player, you can join the [community group](https://go.flweb.cn/qunmcwp "Community Group") to exchange ideas.

## Summary
Looking back over the past two months, **MCJPG** has achieved remarkable accomplishments. However, we know that there is a long way to go. We will continue to strive to expand our organization, improve technical levels, strengthen promotion, optimize the review mechanism, and provide better services to players and server owners.

## Lastly
**Happy National Day to everyone!**
