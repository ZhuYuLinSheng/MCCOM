# 2025 New Year Special

**Happy New Year, everyone!** Before we know it, **MCJPG** has been with you for half a year.  
**MCJPG** sends New Year greetings to everyone.

## Year-End Summary

Over the past year, the various initiatives of **MCJPG** have gradually been improved, and all the unfinished projects have been completed.  
This young and vibrant organization has finally embraced standardization.  
During the winter break, we conducted a **re-evaluation** of existing member servers, enhancing the gaming experience for players.  
We reformed the internal structure of the organization to ensure the correctness of decision-making.

## Annual Project - AI Chat

After internal testing, [MCJPG Chat](https://chat.mcjpg.org), built on LobeChat, is officially released.  
We have established a multi-modal application chain of AI tools, using AI to solve various issues in the development environment.

### Advantages

By adopting stable upstream official API integration, we ensure the stable provision of our services.  
Built on a mature framework, user data security is tenfold or even ninefold assured (not even we can see it).  
We offer famous domestic and international commercial large language models like GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini 2.0, and DeepSeek R1 for users to use free of charge, with no payment options, entirely supported by community unconditional donations.

## Finally

We wish everyone good health, career progress, and academic success in the new year.  
In the coming time, we will continue to strive, expand the organization, improve technical levels, strengthen publicity and promotion, optimize review mechanisms, and provide better services to players and server owners.
